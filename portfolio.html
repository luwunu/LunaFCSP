		This is a snowman decorative game where you can either customize the snowmans scarf or say no and make the snowman sad.
		The player is given 4 color options to customize the snowman in any way they would like and it's super fun to see the snowman
		 all happy in the end!

	<br>
    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		This is a play on the apple catcher game we saw as a reference and the point of the game is to catch 10/10 flowers to reveal a beautiful bouquet at the end!
		We decided to use Minecraft flowers instead of regular flowers to make it more original!

    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		This e-card was inspired by a game called Brawl Stars and the point of the e-card is to ask somebody to homecoming! You have to press the Starrdrop 6 times in 
		order to reveal the awesome e-card to surprise your homecoming date (hopefully they like Brawl Stars)!

	<br>
    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		This coding project was based on malware, cyber security, and pass keys. We used a public key and a private key to decrypt certain bits of code to reveal a fish tank.
	    	The fish tank would show all levels of the water as "OK" which we had to fix so the code showed the true levels of the fish tank ao the fish wont die. This project was 
	    	very confusing but it taught me lots.

    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		During this project, we were given free range for ur creative mindsets on scratch and I decided to create a Christmas House Decoration game which allows 
	    	the user to choose any decor they want to make their house all festive!

	<br>
    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		For this simple project, we designed a GUI that allows the user to gain knowledge about network recieving and sending from any website link of their 
	    	choosing. It was fun to design the GUI as I made it very cute and pink!

    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:250%">  Using Data Graphs To Determine A Biome</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/luwunu/LunaFCSP/blob/main/images/3.1.6projectphotos.png?raw=true" height="300">
	<br>
    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		For this project, we use several graphs representing sound, light, air, ect to determine a certain environment. We would match the graphs with what we felt was the best option 
	    to represent a biome! In conclusion, we believe it is the Marsh Lands.

    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		For my scratch project, I wanted to create a fun claw machine game thats super cute! I used a lot of lists and forever loops as well as defenitions to help bring my project 
	    all together. The vibrant colors add a really cute touch.

    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:250%"> Honey Production Graph</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/luwunu/LunaFCSP/blob/main/images/Untitled%20design.png?raw=true" height="300">
	<br>
    <h1 style="font-family:monospace;color:#763d61;font-size:150%">
		For the last project in the CSP, we learned about the data that contributes to the production of honey annually in America. This helped us learn about beehives in the world but 
	    also furthered our knowledge in data and graphing through Python code.
